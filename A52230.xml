         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY Upon the Change of MANNERS. BEING A SECOND PART OF
THE True Proteſtants Appeal TO THE CITY and COUNTRY.</head>
            <p>IT has been obſerved, that all Arts, Sciences, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and
the ſeveral Diſpoſitions of Mankind, have acted their Parts by Turns in
this World, ſometimes One being moſt in Vogue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in ſuch a
Country, where, after having Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Time, it was forced to give
ground, and quit the Throne to ſome other new Humor of the Age, which having
had its Turn, was likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to retire, and make place for another:
And all this Remark will reach, I ſuppoſe, to Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it
ſelf; or at leaſt, to thoſe of Hereſie. But I believe; it has hardly
ever been known, that any one Humor in one and the ſame Country, has come
twice upon the Stage by the ſame Methods and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the ſecond time as it
did the former, within the ſpace of Forty Years; which makes it ſeem
ſtrange, that the preſent, at leaſt, ſeeming Deſigns upon the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and its Head, next under God, the King, ſhould have that
full Carrier; and meet with that kind Reception as they now do; by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of
People: Indeed the difference is, that the late ſad Times were uſhered in
by a pretended Popiſh Plot, and the preſent by a helliſh, true and real
one; but its Neck being, I hope, broken, I know not why it ſhould be allowed
to be made uſe of for the carrying on the ſame Deſigns as brought us ſo
late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Ruin and Deſtruction, and made us groan under the heavieſt
Yoak, and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ever any Nation was oppreſſed with. I
ſay, I cannot imagine how People can be ſo inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as to be lured,
and blinded by the ſame Paint and Pretexts, as drew them, and but ſo
lately, into the extreameſt miſery and Deſolation. Was not a pretended
Conſpiracy of the Papiſts, a Prologue to thoſe ſad Cataſtrophees? Was
not there as full a Cry then as there is now againſt Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Promoters of it? Were not the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miniſters, and Pillars of
the Royal Authority, firſt, maliciouſly and falſly accuſed, and then
pulled down, before they ſtruck at the Crown it ſelf; nay, had the Rebels
not, or at leaſt, did they not pretend to have, in the greateſt Heat and
Fury of the War, that Veneration, Reſpect and Care for his Late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
as to inſert in all their Generals Commiſſions, the Clauſe of
endeavouring to ſave his Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Danger? And did they not give
out, that they only aimed at ſecuring, and recovering his Perſon out of the
Hands of ſuch as abuſed his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that they had no other
Proſpect, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the State? But did we not ſadly find their
Reformation, to be what a Famous Author of this Time, ſays in one of his
Pieces; That it is only leſt to Princes to mend the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe
Commands find general Obedience, and Examples Imitation. For all other Men,
they muſt take it as they find it, and good Men enter into Commerce with it,
rather upon Caution of not being ſpoiled themſelves, than upon hopes of
mending others. At leaſt, this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion becomes Men of my Level, amongſt
whom I have obſerved all Sett Quarrels with the Age, and Pretences of
Reforming it by their own Models, to end commonly like the pains of a Man in a
Little Boat, who tuggs at a Rope that's faſt to a Ship: it looks as if he
reſolved to draw the Ship to him; <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109670:2"/>
but the Truth, and his Meaning, is, to draw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the
Ship, where he gets in when he can, and does like the reſt of the Crew when
he is there. And what a ſad Crew they were, and what horrid Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies they
acted, to our Miſery and Shame, we are but too well acquainted. I bluſh to
think that we whoſe Anceſtors were the moſt famous People in the World,
and whoſe Heroick Actions, perhaps, no other Nation ever did, or can
parallel, ſhould ſo degenerate from their Bravery, as to lay the whole
Scene of our Honour, in nurſing and uſhering in Rebellion. The main Cry, is
againſt Arbitrary Government, and at the ſame time, thoſe who bawl ſo
loud againſt it, take the right Courſe to bring in the rankeſt Tyranny.
They would have, or at leaſt, they ſay, they would, the Religion and Laws
of the Nation preſerved; but they do not mention, as they are now
eſtabliſhed. I am apt to think, that thoſe who make all this Buſtle,
are not People of Quality, Eſtates, or Sence, but ſuch, whoſe Fortunes
being deſperate, hope to mend them by a Change, and are ſeconded in it by
Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who are maintained, and get a Livelihood by diſperſing all
manner of ill Reports, Principles, and every thing that tends, and is capable
to help on their Deſigns, by infuſing Jealouſies and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions into
the People, by irritating and drawing upon us the Fury of ſome of our
Neighbour-Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and rendering us contemptible, neglected and deſpiſed
by the others, by defaming all thoſe who ſeem Loyal, and able to
aſſiſt the Crown; and by elevating to the Skies, and making even Gods of
thoſe who are thought to favour their Deſigns, and by a thouſand other
Arts and Means, alienate the Peoples minds from the Government, and inſinuate
into them Diſguſts, Diſſaffection and Fears of thoſe at the Helm.
Such People as take, or favour theſe Courſes, I cannot imagine to be
Perſons of Eſtates and Prudence, ſince, ſhould they take Effect, they
would run the Riſque of loſing what they have, without any probability or
proſpect of bettering themſelves; the Truth of which, we have but too late
and deplorable Examples of: For did not even the ſo called Parliament it
ſelf, ſerve for a Stalking Horſe to ſome Diſſaffected People and
Upſtarts who, when by its means they had got into the Saddle, how they rid
and haraſs'd both it, and generally the Three Kingdoms, is ſo well known,
that, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, we ſhould all be ſo ſenſible of it, as not to be drawn
into the ſame Snares again. Did any of thoſe Great Men, who were Promoters
of the Late Troubles compaſs or enjoy long that Splendor and Greatneſs they
aimed at? Were they not put by, and turned out, by people that roſe from
nothing, or at leaſt, if ſome were kept in, it was in Places, that were of
no Profit to them; and only becauſe their Names were advantageous to their
Party. It is this that hinders me from giving Credit to thoſe Reports which
ſay, that all this now is the Sence of the Nation, and that it is influenced
by ſeveral Grandees. Perhaps indeed, there may be ſome few, whoſe too
greedy Ambition having met with Checks, and being new ſpirited with Revenge,
are glad to find the Nation in a Fever, and its Pulſe beat ſo high; and who
inſtead of ſeeking Remedies, feed the Diſeaſe, and inflame the Humors,
not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring the Kingdom into utter Ruine and Deſolation, ſo they
may but have the Opportunities of ſatisfying their Irregular Appetites and
Paſſions: and perhaps theſe may have drawn in amongſt the reſt,
ſeveral well-meaning People, who having things ſhewn them in falſe
Lights, are content to go along with the Stream, ignorantly thinking, it is for
the Publick Good. It is theſe, and ſuch like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this
Juncture, that make me lament my Misfortune of being born in an Age, wherein
Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is run down, the True Proteſtant Religion, that is the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is trodden under foot, and its
Miniſters reviled and beſpattered by every Fiery Diſſenter; and each
Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subject is branded with all the Infamous Names and Epithites they are
capable of inventing.</p>
            <p>Affairs being in this ſad and deplorable Poſture, I appeal
to the whole World, if every True <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man has not reaſon to be
grieved to the very Heart, to ſee ſo many endeavouring to ſow the Seed of
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention and Jealouſies, inſtead of procuring Union and a good
Underſtanding between the King and his People, eſpecially in a Juncture,
when every Day brings us freſh Tidings of the great Preparations, both by Sea
and Land, of ſome of our Neighbours, whoſe Ambition, Intereſt and
Revenge, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prompt them to lay hold of all Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; at the
leaſt, of humbling us, who have been ſuch Obſtacles and Oppoſers of
their great Aims and Deſigns, as they cannot but highly reſent it; and will
doubtleſs embrace all Occaſions they can meet with of procuring our Ruin. I
ſay, in ſuch a time, to foſter, nouriſh, and ſpread abroad, Fears,
Diſtractions, and Diſcontents, can never be the Part of a True
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, a Loyal Subject, and a Real and Religious
Proteſtant.</p>
